                                disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including all statutory claims and
                                disputes, arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Services that

                                individual basis, except that you and SpeakAme are not required to arbitrate any dispute
                                in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights,
                                trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. To be clear: The phrase “all

                                Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
                                enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration will be initiated through
                                the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and will be governed by the AAA Consumer
                                Arbitration Rules, available here as of the date of these Terms, or by calling the AAA
                                at 1-800-778-7879. If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an
                                alternative arbitral forum. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of
                                this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. A single
                                neutral arbitrator will conduct the arbitration. Any claims or disputes where the total
                                amount sought is less than $10,000 USD may be resolved through binding
                                non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims
                                or disputes where the total amount sought is $10,000 USD or more, the right to a hearing
                                will be determined by the arbitral forum’s rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by
                                the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

                                Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is
                                elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions, or
                                any combination of the three; the party initiating the arbitration will choose the
                                specific manner. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties
                                or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise

                                Fees. If you choose to arbitrate with SpeakAme, you will not have to pay any fees to do
                                so. That is because SpeakAme will reimburse you for your filing fee and the AAA’s
                                Consumer Arbitration Rules provide that any hearing fees and arbitrator compensation are
                                our responsibility. To the extent, another arbitral forum is selected; SpeakAme will pay
                                that forum’s fees as well.

                                Authority of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the
                                arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and SpeakAme. The dispute will
                                not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.
                                The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of
                                any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages
                                and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under law, the
                                arbitral forum’s rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and
                                statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the
                                award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the
                                same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law
                                would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and SpeakAme.

                                GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and SpeakAme are instead
                                electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are
                                typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court
                                and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and
                                SpeakAme over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND SPEAKAME WAIVE
                                ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a
                                judge.
                            </li>

                                Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF
                                THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND
                                NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR
                                LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however,
                                this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither
                                you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved
                                in a court as set forth in Section 18.
                            </li>

                                Right to Waive. The party against whom the claim is asserted may waive any rights and
                                limitations set forth in this arbitration agreement. Such waiver will not waive or
                                affect any other portion of this arbitration agreement.
                            </li>

                                Opt-out. You may opt out of this arbitration agreement. If you do so, neither you nor
                                SpeakAme can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify SpeakAme in
                                writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration
                                agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your SpeakAme username and
                                the email address you used to set up your SpeakAme account (if you have one), and an
                                unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement.
                            </li>

                                Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or SpeakAme may bring an
                                individual action in small claims court.
                            </li>

                                Arbitration Agreement Survival. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination
                                of your relationship with SpeakAme.
